## User Experience (UX)
---
### Strategy

With the core UX Principles in mind, I began brain storming and deciding who my target audience for my road trip website and the features I can intergrate that can benefit users. 

Following the pandemic, there are circa three years worth of missed years where people were unable to travel and explore. We are seeing more [young people](https://www.travelmarketreport.com/RetailStrategies/articles/Younger-Travelers-Plan-to-Travel-More-Spend-More-Post-Pandemic) wanting to travel and have new experiences to make up for lost time. 

The target audience for Open Road are:
- 21-35 year olds
- People who seek adventure and not afraid to go on the off beaten track
- People that have potentially less responsibilities and are able to take a road trip
- People who enjoy getting inspiration from others experiences and sharing their own
