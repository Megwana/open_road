## User Experience (UX)
---
### Strategy

With the core UX Principles in mind, I began brain storming and deciding who my target audience for my road trip website and the features I can intergrate that can benefit users. 

The target audience for Open Road are:
- 21-35 year olds
- People who seek adventure and not afraid to go on the off beaten track
- People that have potentially less responsibilities and are able to take a road trip
- People who enjoy getting inspiration from others experiences and sharing their own

Following the pandemic, there are circa three years worth of missed years people were unable to travel and explore. We are seeing more [young people](https://www.travelmarketreport.com/RetailStrategies/articles/Younger-Travelers-Plan-to-Travel-More-Spend-More-Post-Pandemic) wanting to travel and have new experiences to make up for lost time. 

As the site is specifically road trip orientated travel, younger people often go on holiday with friends and have potentially less responsibilities such as children/mortgage. A road trip can be as short or as long as you want it to be, providing flexibility.

The users will be looking for:
- The ability to navigate the site with ease.
- Read concise information about road trips the user is interested in. 
- The user is able to create a user account. Which links to the following point below:
- The ability to share their own experiences via writing their own blog or commenting on another post. 

Due to the site being able towards a younger audience who often browse on mobile devices; I will use bootstrap elements to customise and create a responsive site. Often young people are looking for a memory building experience with friends/ loved ones or finding themselves in a solo experience; which road trips can offer. 

### User Stories


### Scope

To achieve both user and business goals, I will include the following features:

### Structure
The design of website is made to be clean cut and simple. This is to offer key information quick and locate what is desired rather than reading unessary information. 

App structure:

#### Skeleton
