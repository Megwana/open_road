## User Experience (UX)
---
### Strategy

With the core UX Principles in mind, I began brain storming and deciding who my target audience for my road trip website and the features I can intergrate that can benefit users. 

The target audience for Open Road are:
- 21-35 year olds
- People who seek adventure and not afraid to go on the off beaten track
- People that have potentially less responsibilities and are able to take a road trip
- People who enjoy getting inspiration from others experiences and sharing their own

Following the pandemic, there are circa three years worth of missed years people were unable to travel and explore. We are seeing more [young people](https://www.travelmarketreport.com/RetailStrategies/articles/Younger-Travelers-Plan-to-Travel-More-Spend-More-Post-Pandemic) wanting to travel and have new experiences to make up for lost time. 

As the site is specifically road trip orientated travel, younger people often go on holiday with friends and have potentially less responsibilities such as children/mortgage. A road trip can be as short or as long as you want it to be, providing flexibility.

The users will be looking for:
- The ability to navigate the site with ease.
- Read concise information about road trips the user is interested in. 
- The user is able to create a user account. Which links to the following point below:
- The ability to share their own experiences via writing their own blog or commenting on another post. 

Due to the site being able towards a younger audience who often browse on mobile devices; I will use bootstrap elements to customise and create a responsive site. Often young people are looking for a memory building experience with friends/ loved ones or finding themselves in a solo experience; which road trips can offer. 

### User Stories


### Scope

To achieve both user and business goals, I will include the following features:

### Structure
The design of website is made to be clean cut and simple. This is to offer key information quick and locate what is desired rather than reading unessary information. 

App structure:

#### Skeleton

## Deployment 
The main branch of my repository open_road, has been used for the deployment of this application.

### Github and Gitpod

In order to deploy my Django application, I used the Code Institute Python Essentials Template.

Instructions: 
- Click on `Use This Template` button.
- Then create a repository name and a concise description.
- Click on `Create Repository from Template`. This will then create your repository and open up into its repository page.
- Then create a Gitpod Workspace. Click on `Gitpod`. Expect a few minutes of loading while it sets up.
- Rule of thumb should be to return to the Gitpod Workspace when you want to continue working on the project rather than clicking on `Gitpod` in your repository; as this will create a new workspace rather than continue on the one you are currently working on. 
- (Optional: but it is good to pin your workspace so that it isn't deleted).
- It is important to commit your work carried out often with clear messages. The following commands are used:
3 Step Commit Process:
    - `git add .`: adds **ALL** modified files to staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining what you are committing"`: commits changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all committed changes to the subject Github repository.
